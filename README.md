# Semantic_Segmentation
Using the KITTI Dataset to perform pixelwise classification of road images.

Object detection in images has been continously advancing with more efficient and accurate research papers being released every year. One of the most famous types of object detection is semantic segmentation, which involves alligning every pixel with a particuar class of object. To explain this further look at the example below: every pixel in the ouput is given different color depending on whether that pixel is a road, vehicle, traffic sign, tree, human, etc. This pixel wise classification of images into different classes is known as semantic segmentation.
